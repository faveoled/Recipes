[Name] Enchant
[Summary] A generic spell checking library
[Description] Enchant is a cross-platform abstract layer for spell-checking. It is a meta spell-checking framework. It recognizes that different languages often require radically different tools and alogrithms to spell-check and correct. It also takes into account that systems often have a radical host of spell- checking software installed. It provides a standard C API/ABI for all of its backends, while allowing multiple backends to be loaded and used at once.
